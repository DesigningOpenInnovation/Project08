ADDRESSING THREATS!!
- the system is considered a trustworthy source in terms of transaction and payment
- the system offers insurance for the transaction
- payment through Pay Pal ensures the money won't be charged fron the buyer until the product reaches him/her
- the only way to get feedback and comments from buyers is through the system

TWO SIDED NETWORKS
+ They require coordination: 
  If you build up one side of the network, and not the other, you don’t make money (imagine eBay with lots of buyers and no listings).
+ They can be difficult to figure out: 
  it’s hard to get one user acquisition model right, let alone two. Often times, buyers and sellers for marketplaces must be reached through different marketing channels. This means optimizing two sets of user acquisition models. There has been lots of great thinking on how to seed one side of the market first.
+ They can be costly: 
  Marketing to both sides of the marketplace costs money. Iterating through your acquisition models costs money. Two-sided networks cost money to build.
