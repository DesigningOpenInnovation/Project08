(Delicious Leftovers: what to cook from the food that is left from a meal?)

What will you do with your old clothes? - especially those beautiful dresses that you don't use anymore!
Would you like to sell them to someone to be able to buy a new dress for yourself?
Or would you like to co-create fashion with others?

Now it is possible - with dress matchmaker! 

How does it work?

Take a picture of your existing dress, upload it online, set a price and give a description
Post the offer and browse the offers from other users
Apply to requests, sell your dress and buy a new one
By giving comments after a purchase you improve the user profiles
You can add pictures on your profile to show what kinds of dressess attract your interest 

You can co create your own styles by combining the different items available online. Others can comment on your designed outfit.            It can also have a phot hub where you post pictures of your self in the dresses you bought using this service.

Give up from old - get a new one!

I like the idea with the outfits virtual market! :)
